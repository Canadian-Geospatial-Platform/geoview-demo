# GeoView Demo Architecture

## Overview

The GeoView Demo project is designed to showcase the capabilities of the GeoView library. This document provides an overview of the architecture, including the main components and their interactions.

## Functionality



## The UI Structure

The UI structure consists mainly of two sections. The map and the drawers sections.
The map basically renders the generated map.
The drawer consists of different tabs - each displaying information about the map or offering a way of manipulating the map.


## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the UI to perform actions such as viewing maps or querying geospatial data.
2. **API Requests**: The UI sends requests to the backend services via RESTful APIs.
3. **Data Processing**: The backend services process the requests, interact with the data storage, and perform necessary computations.
4. **Response**: The backend services send the processed data back to the UI.
5. **Display**: The UI updates the display based on the received data.

## Deployment

### Development Environment
- **Tools**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Description**: The development environment uses Docker to ensure consistency across different setups.

### Production Environment
- **Tools**: Kubernetes, Helm
- **Description**: The production environment uses Kubernetes for orchestration and Helm for managing deployments.

## Conclusion

This architecture ensures a modular and scalable approach to building the GeoView Demo project. Each component is designed to handle specific responsibilities, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

## Folder Structure

The GeoView Demo project follows a structured layout to maintain clarity and organization. Below is an overview of the main folders and their purposes:

```
/geoview-demo
├── /docs
├── /src
│   ├── /components
│   ├── /services
│   ├── /utils
│   └── /styles
├── /public
├── /config
└── /tests
```

### /docs
- **Purpose**: Contains all the documentation related to the project, including architectural overviews, API documentation, and user guides.

### /src
- **Purpose**: The main source code of the project.
- **Subfolders**:
    - **/components**: Contains React components used in the UI.
    - **/services**: Contains service modules for interacting with backend APIs.
    - **/utils**: Utility functions and helpers used across the project.
    - **/styles**: CSS and styling files for the application.

### /public
- **Purpose**: Static files that are publicly accessible, such as HTML templates, images, and other assets.

### /config
- **Purpose**: Configuration files for different environments (development, production, etc.).

### /tests
- **Purpose**: Contains test cases and testing utilities to ensure code quality and functionality.

This folder structure promotes a clean separation of concerns, making the project easier to navigate and maintain.
